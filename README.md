## Program vs Process vs Thread

### Program

A program is a set of instructions and associated data that resides on the disk and is loaded by the operating system to perform some task.  
In order to run a program, the operating system's kernel is first asked to create a new process, which is an   
environment in which a program executes.


### Process
- A process is a program in execution.  
- A process is an execution environment that consists of 
 - instructions, 
 - user-data, and 
 - System-data segments, as well as lots of other resources such as CPU, memory, address-space, disk and network I/O acquired at runtime.   
A program can have several copies of it running at the same time but a process necessarily belongs   
to only one program.


### Thread

- Thread is the smallest unit of execution in a process.   
- A thread simply executes instructions serially.  
- A process can have multiple threads running as part of it. Usually, there would be some state associated with the process that is shared among all the threads and in turn each   
thread would have some state private to itself. The globally shared state amongst the threads of a process is visible and accessible to all the threads, and special attention needs to be paid when any thread tries to read or write to this global shared state. There are several   
constructs offered by various programming languages to guard and discipline the access to this global state, which we will go into further detail in upcoming lessons.


```java
import java.util.Random;

class DemoThreadUnsafe {

    // We'll use this to randomly sleep our threads
    static Random random = new Random(System.currentTimeMillis());

    public static void main(String args[]) throws InterruptedException {

        // create object of unsafe counter
        ThreadUnsafeCounter badCounter = new ThreadUnsafeCounter();

        // setup thread1 to increment the badCounter 200 times
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new Runnable() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                    badCounter.increment();
                    DemoThreadUnsafe.sleepRandomlyForLessThan10Secs();
                }
            }
        });

        // setup thread2 to decrement the badCounter 200 times
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new Runnable() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
                    badCounter.decrement();
                    DemoThreadUnsafe.sleepRandomlyForLessThan10Secs();
                }
            }
        });

        // run both threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        // wait for t1 and t2 to complete.
        thread1.join();
        thread2.join();

        // print final value of counter
        badCounter.printFinalCounterValue();
    }

    public static void sleepRandomlyForLessThan10Secs() {
        try {
            Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10));
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
        }
    }
}

class ThreadUnsafeCounter {

    int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public void decrement() {
        count--;
    }

    void printFinalCounterValue() {
        System.out.println("counter is: " + count);
    }
}


```


## Synchronous vs Asynchronous

### Synchronous

- Synchronous execution refers to line-by-line execution of code.  
- If a function is invoked, the program execution waits until the function call is completed.  
- Synchronous execution blocks at each method call before proceeding to the next line of code. A program executes in the same sequence as the code in the source code file.  
- Synchronous execution is synonymous to serial execution.

### Asynchronous

- Asynchronous (or async) execution refers to execution that doesn't block when invoking subroutines.

- An asynchronous program doesnâ€™t wait for a task to complete and can move on to the next task.

## I/O Bound vs CPU Bound



We write programs to solve problems. Programs utilize various resources of the computer systems on which they run. For instance a program running on your machine will broadly require:

 - CPU Time

 - Memory

 - Networking Resources

 - Disk Storage

Depending on what a program does, it can require heavier use of one or more resources. For instance, a program that loads gigabytes of data from storage into main memory would hog the main memory of the machine it runs on. Another can be writing several gigabytes to permanent storage, requiring abnormally high disk i/o.

### CPU Bound

Programs which are compute-intensive i.e. program execution requires very high utilization of the CPU (close to 100%) are called CPU bound programs. Such programs primarily depend on improving CPU speed to decrease program completion time.

This could include programs such as data crunching, image processing, matrix multiplication etc.
